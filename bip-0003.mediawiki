  BIP: 3
  Layer: Applications
  Title: Bitcoin URIs
  Author: Ryan X. Charles <ryan@moneybutton.com>

The format for Bitcoin SV (BSV) URIs is as follows:

<code>
bitcoinsv:[address]?[querystring]
</code>

Where:

* [address] is a base58check encoded address (the original format)

* [querystring] is the (optional) rest of the query string, which may include Payment Protocol parameters or anything else

The format is exactly the same as BIP 21 except that we prefix it with bitcoinsv: to disambiguate BSV from BTC.
